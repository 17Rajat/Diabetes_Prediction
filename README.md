# Diabetes_prediction
This repository consists of all the files which are required from prediction of model to deployment, which predicts whether a person is diabetic or not.

This model is deployed with the help of Flasgger(i.e swagger api, which is used as Front-end for the web app) and heroku(a cloud platform).

The deployed model can be visited on https://ml-diabetes-api-predict.herokuapp.com/apidocs/.

This Web App has very simple interface because instead of html, css etc. swagger api has been used.
